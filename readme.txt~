Information about the rescale tool
==================================

The rescale tool takes a number of 32-bit little-endian floating point
binary files, finds the extents of the data across all the files, and
rescales them within some percentile boundaries whilst writing them
out individually as 8-bit files.

It combines two common operations across n files that are performed
post-reconstuction
